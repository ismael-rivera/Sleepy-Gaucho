Starkers is not intended for updating but in the event of having to update due to incompatibility with wordpress at least this should help out a little with the process. Mind you it is not perfect but it will help.

In the event of updating starkers theme, please review all the files in this folder. These files are the original files that came with starkers theme. These files are here solely for the purpose of reference. They are no being used because they have been replaced with copies for the purposes of cutomization. In the case of an update, they would serve as a reference to all the equally named counterparts that have been altered one level below. all of the files that have been altered (which are referenced here by the originals) are to be moved to a different directory before the rest of the theme is replaced. 

In other words, say that you wish to replace this version of Starkers theme with a new one; what you would do then first would be to go into this folders and look at the files inside. No need to open them. These files are the originals. 

Next go back to the root folder of the theme (not the wordpress root but inside of the starkers theme, theme root folder will be right after clicking inside 'Starkers' folder). Inside grab all of the files with the same name as those files in the originals folder and place them in a new folder. Name the folder something along the lines of 'theme custom files - do not delete'. Grab everything altered including css files and anything else delete.

Replace starkers with new one.
